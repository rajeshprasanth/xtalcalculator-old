The executables in this package can calculate real space lattice vector,
reciprocal lattice vector and brillouin zone volume.

Installation:

The installation of this package is much easier.
Follow the step so that you can install the package without much pain.

commands for impatience!
   1) unzip and untar the package using the following command
          $ tar zxvf XtalCalculator-2.1.0.tar.gz
      or if your version of tar does not recognize 'z' flag, try
          $ gunzip -c XtalCalculator-2.1.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

      A directory 'XtalCalculator-2.1.0' should have been created.
   
   2) Issue the command
          $ cd XtalCalculator-2.1.0
          $ ./configure
	 
   3) Issue the command
          $ make <targets>
            
          Issuing make without targets will lists all possible targets.

   After sucessfull compilation the binaries are placed in the 'Bin' directory.
They can be executed by issuing
            
         $ cd Bin
         $ ./xtalcalculator.x
 
   The executable xtalcalculator.x starts with the welcome message and a beautifull
stick image of Sodium Chloride crystal with start time.

   The executable without command line arguments return back the error to issue the
proper command.

   Input files can be prepared manually. But I suggest the users to make use of 
inputmaker.x program to generate the formatted input file for xtalcalculator.
inputmaker.x can be compiled in /Tools/inputmaker/Src.

   Example files with reference outputs are also been added to enable the users to 
know more about the usage of inputfiles and the xtalcalculator.

   Testsuites are also added for test the standard performance of the code.
 
   The program can be executed by issuing the following command
	
	$ xtalcalculator.x file.in file.out

   The program resolve.x is a converse program for xtalcalculator.x.
This program compute the lattice parameters from the primitive lattice vectors.
